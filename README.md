### Steps to Run the App

### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
Ensuring the code was bug free and passed tests- wanted to display that I am thorough in my code with documentation, sufficient testing, and error handling
### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
5 hours - 20 minutes planning, 10 minutes setting up project, 3 hours coding/ building, 1:30 minutes testing/ debigging
### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Didnt paginate the recipes, so if the dataset gets large, it would be slow
### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
UI could be more thorough when the user clicks on a recipe- time constraints limited how advanced I wanted it. Didnt handle when videos arent available.
### External Code and Dependencies: Did you use any external code, libraries, or dependencies?
Kingfisher for image caching, YoutubePlayerKit to allow the user to play the app inside the app. SafariServices to open the browser in the app.
### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
Had a great time doing this project! Due to time constraints, some optimizations like pagination, sorting/filtering were left out. With more time UI could get much cleaner.
